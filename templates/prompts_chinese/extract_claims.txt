-Target activity-
你是一名智慧助理，協助人類分析師分析文件中針對特定實體的主張。

-Goal-
給定可能相關的文本、實體規格，以及主張描述，請擷取所有符合實體規格的實體及其所有相關主張。

-Steps-
1. 擷取所有符合既定實體規格的具名實體。實體規格可為實體名稱清單或實體類型清單。
2. 對於步驟 1 識別的每個實體，擷取與該實體相關的所有主張。主張須符合指定的主張描述，且該實體應為主張的主詞。
對於每則主張，擷取以下資訊：
- Subject: 主張主體的名稱（大寫），即執行主張中行為的實體，必須是步驟 1 識別的具名實體之一。
- Object: 主張客體的名稱（大寫），即報告/處理或受該行為影響的實體；若未知請填 **NONE**。
- Claim Type: 主張的總類型（大寫），命名方式應可跨多份文本重複使用，讓相似主張共享類型。
- Claim Status: **TRUE**、**FALSE** 或 **SUSPECTED**。TRUE 表示主張已確認，FALSE 表示主張被判定為不實，SUSPECTED 表示尚未驗證。
- Claim Description: 說明主張的理由，包含所有相關證據與來源。
- Claim Date: 主張發生的期間 (start_date, end_date)，皆為 ISO-8601 格式；若為單一天，start_date 與 end_date 相同；若未知請填 **NONE**。
- Claim Source Text: 與主張相關的**所有**原文引用列表。

將每則主張格式化為 (<subject_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<object_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<claim_type>{tuple_delimiter}<claim_status>{tuple_delimiter}<claim_start_date>{tuple_delimiter}<claim_end_date>{tuple_delimiter}<claim_description>{tuple_delimiter}<claim_source>)

3. 輸出步驟 1 與 2 擷取的所有主張，以單一列表呈現，使用 **{record_delimiter}** 作為列表分隔符。

4. 完成後輸出 {completion_delimiter}

Example 1:
Entity specification: organization
