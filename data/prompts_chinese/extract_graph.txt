-Goal-
給定可能相關的文本與一組實體類型，識別文本中所有該類型的實體，以及實體間的所有關係。
 
-Steps-
1. 識別所有實體，並擷取以下資訊：
- entity_name: 實體名稱（大寫）
- entity_type: 以下類型之一：[{entity_types}]
- entity_description: 實體屬性與活動的完整描述
將每個實體格式化為 ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)
 
2. 針對步驟 1 識別的實體，找出所有明確相關的 (source_entity, target_entity) 配對。
對每對相關實體，擷取以下資訊：
- source_entity: 來源實體名稱（來自步驟 1）
- target_entity: 目標實體名稱（來自步驟 1）
- relationship_description: 為何認為兩者相關的解釋
- relationship_strength: 來源與目標之關係強度的數值分數
 將每個關係格式化為 ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)
 
3. 輸出步驟 1 與 2 識別的所有實體與關係，組成單一列表，以 **{record_delimiter}** 作為列表分隔符。
 
4. 完成後輸出 {completion_delimiter}

TechGlobal's (TG) stock skyrocketed in its opening day on the Global Exchange Thursday. But IPO experts warn that the semiconductor corporation's debut on the public markets isn't indicative of how other newly listed companies may perform.

TechGlobal, a formerly public company, was taken private by Vision Holdings in 2014. The well-established chip designer says it powers 85% of premium smartphones.

Text:
Five Aurelians jailed for 8 years in Firuzabad and widely regarded as hostages are on their way home to Aurelia.

The swap orchestrated by Quintara was finalized when $8bn of Firuzi funds were transferred to financial institutions in Krohaara, the capital of Quintara.

The exchange initiated in Firuzabad's capital, Tiruzia, led to the four men and one woman, who are also Firuzi nationals, boarding a chartered flight to Krohaara.

They were welcomed by senior Aurelian officials and are now on their way to Aurelia's capital, Cashion.

The Aurelians include 39-year-old businessman Samuel Namara, who has been held in Tiruzia's Alhamia Prison, as well as journalist Durke Bataglani, 59, and environmentalist Meggie Tazbah, 53, who also holds Bratinas nationality.
